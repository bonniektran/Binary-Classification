# Binary-Classification
This repository contains projects on binary classification.

Mushroom Data - Artificial Neural Networks
- Cleaned data and used Lasso (L1 regularization) to reduce dimensionality.
- Trained and finedtuned an ANN model to predict whether mushrooms are poisonous or edible, achieving a 98.47% testing accuracy.

Bird Strikes in Aviation - ML Compilation
- Cleaned data using a variety of encoding methods such as mapping, rare labelling, and frequency encoding.
- Used XGBoost feature importance for dimensionality reduction.
- Trained and finetuned several hyperparameters on the following ML and deep learning models:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
    - Linear, poly, radial, and sigmoid
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Artifical Neural Networks 
  - Recurrent Neural Networks
    - LSTM and GRU
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
- Achieved a 98% for both random forest and KNN models, and a 90-91% testing accuracy for both ANN and LSTM models.
